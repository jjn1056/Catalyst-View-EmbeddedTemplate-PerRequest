=head1 NAME

Catalyst::View::EmbeddedPerl - Views using Template::EmbeddedPerl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For now this view is only available as a PerRequest view, so see
See L<Catalyst::View::EmbeddedPerl::PerRequest> for more.

This is a placeholder in case I want to release a 'traditional' per application
version of this view.
